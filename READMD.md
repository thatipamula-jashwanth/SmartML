# ***SmartML***

***SmartML*** is a **CPU-first machine learning benchmarking library** focused on **fair, leakage-free, and reproducible evaluation** of tabular machine learning models.

SmartML is part of the ***SmartEco*** ecosystem.

---

## ### Core Principles

- **CPU-only by default**
- **Deterministic and reproducible benchmarks**
- **Zero data leakage**
- **Minimal but safe preprocessing**
- **Honest model availability detection**
- **Fair comparison across models**

> SmartML only exposes models that actually run on the current system.

No fake availability. No “works on my GPU” nonsense.

---

## ### Intended Use & Scope

SmartML is **not a commercial AutoML system**.

It is an **internal benchmarking and evaluation tool**, designed to:
- Compare models fairly under identical conditions
- Measure real-world CPU performance
- Ensure leakage-free and reproducible results

All models are evaluated using:
- Fixed default hyperparameters
- Identical preprocessing
- Identical train/test splits

No model is tuned, favored, or given any special advantage.

SmartML prioritizes **fairness, transparency, and repeatability** over leaderboard-style optimization.

For full details on:
- Default hyperparameters
- Preprocessing rules
- Benchmark methodology

Please refer to the official ***SmartEco*** documentation and website.

---

## ### Installation

SmartML is used as part of the ***SmartEco*** package.

Install SmartEco in editable mode from the directory that contains the `SmartEco` folder.

### ***Required Dependencies***

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

### ***Optional Dependencies***

Installing these unlocks additional models:

- `lightgbm`
- `xgboost`
- `catboost`
- `interpret` (for NAM / Explainable Boosting)
- `pytorch-tabnet`
- `torch` (CPU)
- `smart-knn` (SmartEco-native)

> Some research libraries are platform-dependent and may not be available on Windows CPU.  
> SmartML automatically hides unavailable models.

---

## ### Data Encoding & Preprocessing

SmartML uses **minimal, transparent, and safe preprocessing**.

### ***Feature Encoding***

- **Numerical features**  
  Passed directly without modification.

- **Categorical features**
  - Low-cardinality → **One-Hot Encoding (OHE)**
  - High-cardinality → **Target Encoding**

### ***Target Encoding Safety***

- Computed **only on the training split**
- Validation and test data **never influence encoding**
- Guarantees **zero target leakage**

Additional guarantees:
- Classification targets → label-encoded
- Regression targets → remain continuous
- Encoding logic is **task-aware**
- Test targets are **never used** during preprocessing
- Linear models are **feature-scaled** to ensure fair and stable benchmarking

---

## ### Train / Test Split

- Fixed random seed is always used
- Default split is deterministic
- Stratification is applied automatically for classification
- Regression splits are random but reproducible

This ensures:
- Identical splits across runs
- Fair comparison between models
- Benchmark repeatability

---

## ### Available Models

SmartML dynamically detects and exposes models that are usable on the **current machine**.

### ***Classification Models***

Depending on installed dependencies:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees
- LightGBM
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
- NAM (Explainable Boosting)
- TabNet
- **SmartKNN**
- Optional research models (platform-dependent)

---

### ***Regression Models***

Depending on installed dependencies:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso
- ElasticNet
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- KNN Regressor
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees
- LightGBM
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
- NAM (Explainable Boosting)
- TabNet
- **SmartKNN**
- Optional research models (platform-dependent)

---

## ### Model Availability Policy

If a model cannot run on the current system, it **does not appear**.

SmartML:
- Does **not** fake availability
- Does **not** crash on missing dependencies
- Does **not** assume Linux or GPU environments

Model availability is determined **at runtime**.

---

## ### Inspection Utility

SmartML provides a runtime inspection utility called ***SmartML_Inspect***.

It generates a JSON file reporting:
- Available classification models
- Available regression models
- Metrics used by SmartML

> The output reflects **actual runtime capability**, not theoretical support.  
> No terminal output is produced.

---

## ### Evaluation Metrics

### ***Classification Metrics***
- Accuracy
- Macro F1 Score

### ***Regression Metrics***
- R² Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### ***Inference & Performance Metrics***
- Training time
- Batch inference time
- Batch throughput
- Single-sample mean latency
- Single-sample P95 latency

These metrics evaluate **both model quality and real-world performance**.

---

## ### Benchmarking Behavior

For each model, SmartML:

- Uses the same train/test split
- Applies identical preprocessing
- Trains the model
- Measures training time
- Measures batch inference time
- Measures single-sample latency distribution
- Records results in a unified format

Result: **fair, comparable, honest benchmarks**.

---

## ### Platform Notes

- **Windows + CPU** → fully supported
- **Linux / WSL** → additional research models may become available
- **GPU** → not required, not assumed, not enforced

SmartML remains **CPU-safe by default**.

---

## ### Experimental & Research Models

Some models exist in the codebase but may be hidden at runtime due to missing dependencies:

- Torch-Tabular models (MLP, FTTransformer, SAINT, TabTransformer)
- DeepGBM
- GrowNet
- ModernNCA

These models are:
- Guarded by optional imports
- Exposed only when installable
- Never removed from source code

---

## ### Architecture Overview

SmartML is organized into modular components:

- Dataset loading and encoding
- Model registry and availability detection
- Training and benchmarking engine
- Evaluation and inference measurement
- Inspection and reporting

Each component is **deterministic and reproducible**.
